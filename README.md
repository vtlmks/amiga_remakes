# Amiga Remakes

1:1 remakes of classic Amiga demos from the 1980s, reverse-engineered from original M68K assembly.

## Building

Requires both GCC (for Linux binaries) and MinGW (for Windows binaries). Run:
```bash
./build_all.sh
```

Individual demos can be built in their respective directories.

## Status

Active development. Multiple demos are worked on in parallel - some are complete, others may be incomplete or non-functional. No guarantees anything works at any given commit.
